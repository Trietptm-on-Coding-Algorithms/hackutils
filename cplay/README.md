cplay
=====

This is a command-line app for generating and playing with remote services you 
can interact with over raw tcp. It works especially well with buffer-overflow
return-to-libc call-esp style attacks.

Run it without arguments for usage information.

One of these days I'm gonna get around to writing a plugin system for it.
